(ii) getElementsByClass('classname'): Gets all the elements that have the given classname.

(iii) getElementsByTagName('tagname'): Gets all the elements that have the given tag name.

(iv) querySelector(): This function takes css style selector (like #id/.classname/tagname) and returns the first selected element.

(v) querySelectorAll(): Similar to querySelector, this function returns a NodeList of html elements.

6) What is a Typed Language?

Typed Language is in which the values are associated with values and not with variables. It is of two types:

Dynamically: in this, the variable can hold multiple types; like in JS a variable can take number, chars.

Statically: in this, the variable can hold only one type, like in Java a variable declared of string can take only set of characters and nothing else.

NOTE: Typescript is a superset of JS which is of typed language.

7) What does a typeof operator do?

8) Name some of the ways in which Type Conversion is possible.

Type Conversion is to convert from one data type to another data type.

(i) Number to String Conversion.

toString: Other data type to String.
val = (5).toString(); converts integer to string.
val = (true).toString(); converts boolean to string.
Convert from Number/Boolean/Date to String.
Number to String: String(9) converts num to string
Boolean to String: String(true) converts bool to str
Date to String: String(new Date()) date to string
Array to String: String([2,2,2]) Array to string.

(ii) String to Number Conversion.

parseInt: String to Int only (no decimals)
val = parseInt('11'); outputs 100 as number
val = parseFloat('22.22') outputs 22.22 as float
Convert from String/Boolean to Number/Date.
String to Number: Number('9') converts str - num
(9).toFixed(4) gives 9.0000 as the output
Boolean to Number: Number(true) converts to no.
Null to Number: Number(null) converts to no. (0)
Chars to Number: Number('ss') give NaN.

9) What is the difference between Local Storage and Session Storage?

21) What happens when the recursion calling is applied on two functions?

The calling of recursion is possible in two functions, but the call comes to an end after some time.

22) Explain the term closure.

The inner functions can be called as closure when it has access to the outer function's variables.

23) Explain the terms synchronous and asynchronous code.

The synchronous code is something that should be finished before anything else can happen, or in other words, the synchronous code is blocking. And the Asynchronous code is something in which actions can happen and is not dependent on other actions- in other words, it is non-blocking.

24) Name the different types of pop up boxes in Javascript.

Javascript DOM (Document Object Model) Questions

29) What is DOM?

DOM (Document Object Model) is an object-oriented representation of the HTML elements. All the elements (or nodes) are part of window.document.

30) Expand BOM and explain it.

BOM stands for Browser Object Model. Using BOM interaction with a browser is possible. Default object of the browser is a window.

31) What is the difference between window and document in Javascript?

Javascript window is a global object which holds variables, functions, history, location; the document also comes under the window and can be considered as the property of the window.

32) What is the difference between innerHTML and innerText?

innerHTML will process an HTML tag if found in a string, whereas innerText will not. For Example document.querySelector('p').innerHTML='one <br> two'  gives the output one and two in two lines as <br> in html is a new line. Whereas document.querySelector('p').innerText='one <br> two' gives the output of the text as it is in one line.

33) What is the difference between textContent and innerText?

Let us have a paragraph element and a span element in it as a child element.
<p>some text and a <span style="visibility: hidden">span tag hidden <\span>in it</p>
Now, if the following two steps would result in the following-
console.log(document.querySelector('p').textContent); gives some text and a span tag hidden in it.
console.log(document.querySelector('p').innerText); gives some text and a in it.

34) What is the difference between HTMLCollection and NodeList?

The functions querySelectorAll() returns NodeList in which the forEach can be used directly to traverse the elements. Whereas, the getElementsByClassName() or getElementsByTagName() returns an HTMLCollection, which does not have a forEach by default.

35) How can an HTMLCollection be traversed?

The HTMLCollection by default does not have forEach, it needs to be converted into an array (eleName = Array.from(eleName)) and then the traversal is possible using forEach.

36) What is the difference between childNode and children?

A childNode, when used returns a NodeList. Whereas, children, when used; returns an HTMLCollection.

5.    mouseenter: When the mouse cursor enters an external element.

6.    mouseleave: When the mouse cursor leaves an external element.

7.    mouseover: When the mouse cursor enters an internal and external element.

8.    mouseout: When the mouse cursor leaves an internal and external element.

9.    mousemove: When the mouse cursor is moved.
